title: "About"
---

This analytical tool was developed to streamline the processing of serological data generated using a validated high-throughput multiplex serological assay for measuring antibodies to *Plasmodium vivax* ([Longley et al 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0841-4)). This tool also aims to make the downstream processing, quality control, and interpretation of the raw data generated from this serological assay accessible to all researchers without the need for a specialist background in statistical methods and advanced programming.
